## About Scanner Art ## 
Printer scanners, thermo-fax, xerox and the color in colour machines, copiers of all sorts, and other business and science tools have long been used to experiment with the aesthetic boundaries of imaging technologies.
At the intersection of corporate industries, the development of communications technologies, and emerging criticisms of the toxicity of late-capitalist ideologies, formative artists such as Sonia Sheridan aimed to explore the potential for radically new modes of aesthetic, artistic, expression.

In strategically 'misusing' corporate technologies like the photo scanner, xerox machine, and new printing technologies, artists like Sheridan and her many students, would come to establish a number of crucial points of deviation from other image-making practices like photography.
