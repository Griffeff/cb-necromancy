# About The Project

Each of the works of art contained on this website was created for my Master's thesis in **Communication and Culture**.
Each work was created by photographing objects of sentimental value with a CIS (Contact Image Sensor) printer scanner.
Most objects have been distorted, warped, stretched, and abstracted within the image, a result of my interruption and disruption of the object's scan by physically manipulating the materials, the scanner itself, or the platen cover as the CIS bar carries out its scan. 

Throughout the course of my Master's program, I have been developing what I call, a *scanner way of thinking*, a research creation methodology that aims to unite frames of hauntology, affect theory, and material culture. These theoretical frames are considered under my critical conceptual metaphor of ***Necromancy***.

## What am I doing?
Building out of the methodological frame of autotheory, my thesis work emphasizes personal, auto-ethnographic, and memoir-like writing to ground my  theorizations in my own lived experiences of grief, study, and arts-making.

**Ultimately, I argue for the synthesis of these methodological and theoretical frames in order to;**

**1.** Contribute to the development of research creation methodologies for future research creation scholars by offering up a theoretical grounding for scanner art as a methodology

**2.** Provide a unifying theoretical frame for hauntology, autotheory, material culture studies, and affect theory under my own critical conceptual metaphor of *necromancy*

In doing so, I hope to create spaces in which we can consider new ways of grieving that centre interrelationality, to recognize and emphasize our interconnectedness as living and non-living beings, and to do so through an attention to the enchantment of material objects.

To carry out this necromantic practice, I emphasize three primary scopes of consideration within academic spaces.

### 1. Thinking Interpersonally
To think interpersonally is to emphasize your connections to others and recognize your role as a single link upon the extensive chains of interaction that make up our social networks. 
According to Erving Goffman (1959), our presentations of the ‘self’ are filtered through the lens of our interpersonal relationships, shared meaning, cultural backgrounds, and the general tone of our interlocutors.
In our day to day interactions “we carefully assess the context of the interaction in order to decide how we will act, what we will say, and how we might try to construct and present ourselves” (Wesch, 22). The interactions we engage in on a daily basis inform hugely important parts of our sense of self.

Goffman then goes on to describe the role of “sign-vehicles”, or the means by which we extract or express certain semiotic information in our interactions with others (Goffman, 1).
These are the subtle gestural, visual, and tonal values we glean from others in typical interactions, and precisely that which Wesch finds missing and meaningful in our interactions and our attempts to represent ourselves in the physical and social absence of an audience.
Material culture scholar John Robb elaborates on this attention to our interpersonal construction of selfhood by widening our lens to the non-human, to the material; “people act in a flow of action unfolding over time, and interactions with things form a central part of this flow” (Robb, 167).

Robb writes that objects can contain within them an intuitive, sensory knowledge of their function. While these notions have been challenged in discourses of archaeological presumption, Robb hits on something that I believe contains vital energies of magic within them; that is to say, they contain in them a direct acknowledgement of the humanistic ability to glean and discern social, psychological meanings from materials through their visuality and physicality.

Through an attention to the materials that help compose our innately interactive senses of self, we may be able to tune ourselves in to a post-humanist understanding that the lines between ourselves and others (whether they are human, non-human, no-longer-human, and so on).
In doing so, in thinking interpersonally, we might open ourselves up to more ethical, less individualistic, and more interpersonally minded imaginings of self and being. 

### 2. Thinking Spectrally

To think spectrally is to accept the strangeness of loss, embrace the dissonances of grief, and, most importantly, to implement hauntological frames of thinking on our everyday, personal experiences with loss and the past. 
That is to say, to think spectrally is to understand, expect, and critically negotiate with the many ghosts and spectres that will, over the course of time, innevitably come to haunt you, your work, your arts making practices, and your (interpersonal) sense of self.



### 3. Thinking Atemporally
