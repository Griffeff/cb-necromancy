## About The Project

Each of the works of art contained on this website was created for my Master's thesis in **Communication and Culture**.
Each work was created by photographing objects of sentimental value with a CIS (Contact Image Sensor) printer scanner.
Most objects have been distorted, warped, stretched, and abstracted within the image, a result of my interruption and disruption of the object's scan by physically manipulating the materials, the scanner itself, or the platen cover as the CIS bar carries out its scan. 

Throughout the course of my Master's program, I have been developing what I call, a *scanner way of thinking*, a research creation methodology that aims to unite frames of hauntology, affect theory, and material culture. These theoretical frames are considered under my critical conceptual metaphor of ***Necromancy***.

Building out of the methodological frame of autotheory, my thesis work emphasizes personal, auto-ethnographic, and memoir-like writing to ground my  theorizations in my own lived experiences of grief, study, and arts-making.

Ultimately, I argue for the synthesis of these methodological and theoretical frames in order to,
1. Contribute to the development of research creation methodologies for future RC scholars by offering up a critical conceptual grounding for scanner art as a methodology
2. 

### Thinking Personally

### Thinking Spectrally

### Thinking Atemporally
