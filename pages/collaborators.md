The construction of this website could not have been possible without the skillful instruction and support of the CollectionBuilder developers at the University of Idaho;

I'd like to extend a huge thank you to Olivia Wilke, Devin Becker, and Evan Williamson for creating and freely sharing the code for CollectionBuilder as well as for their great work in advocating for more ethical, longer lasting, and more accessible ways to navigate and create on the internet. 

- <a href="https://vivo.nkn.uidaho.edu/vivo/display/n263285">Olivia Wikle</a>
- <a href="https://vivo.nkn.uidaho.edu/vivo/display/n8136">Devin Becker</a>
- <a href="https://vivo.nkn.uidaho.edu/vivo/display/n43629">Evan Williamson</a>

More broadly, I would also like to thank the University of Victoria in British Columbia for hosting the annual <a href="https://dhsi.org/">Digital Humanities Summer Institute</a>, <a href="https://dhsi.org/our-team/">the entire DHSI leadership and operational team</a>, the many phenomenal colleagues who attended DHSI 2023 alongside me, and my peers in the CollectionBuilder class who helped to bring Olivia, Devin, and Evan's instruction to life over the course of just five days.
